                    <p> My name is Peter Miles Anthony Laporre. I'm 21 years old. My house is in the north of Davao Region, 
                        where all the villas are, and I am not married. I am studying in Mapua Malayan Colleges Mindanao, 
                        and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
                        I'm in bed somewhere around 11 PM to 3AM, and make sure I get hours of gaming, no matter what. After 
                        having a glass of warm milk and doing about minimum twenty minutes of gaming before going to 
                        bed, I usually have problems sleeping until morning. Just like an old man, I wake up with any fatigue or stress in the morning. 
                        I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a 
                        person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with 
                        any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. 
                        That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. 
                        Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
