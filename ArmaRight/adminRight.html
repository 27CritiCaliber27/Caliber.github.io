            <h4> Here are the following available firearm types: </h4>
            <h3> Pistols </h3>
            <img src = "glock17.png" width = "500px" height = "250px">
            <p> Pistols, compact and versatile firearms, have earned their place as one of the most 
                iconic and widely used weapon types in modern history. Designed for ease of handling and concealability, 
                these handheld weapons are characterized by their short barrels, often semi-automatic or single-shot action, 
                and the ability to be fired with one hand. Pistols come in a variety of calibers and styles, catering to a wide range 
                of purposes, from self-defense and law enforcement to sport shooting and military applications. Their portability and 
                quick draw make them a popular choice for personal protection, while their precision and maneuverability in close-quarters 
                combat situations make them invaluable tools in the hands of professionals. The evolution of pistol technology has led to 
                advancements in ergonomics, sights, and materials, enhancing their accuracy and reliability. Whether as a sidearm in a 
                soldier's holster or a civilian's concealed carry, pistols remain a symbol of individual empowerment and a testament to 
                the ingenuity of firearm engineering. </p>
            
            <h3> Sub-Machine Guns </h3>
            <img src = "mac10.png" width = "550px" height = "250px">
            <p> Submachine guns (SMGs) represent a distinctive class of firearms, combining the compactness of pistols with the 
                rapid-fire capabilities of larger automatic weapons. These versatile firearms are characterized by their relatively 
                short barrels and the ability to fire pistol-caliber ammunition, typically 9mm, at an exceptionally high rate. 
                SMGs are designed for close-quarters combat scenarios, offering maneuverability, rapid target acquisition, and ease of control. 
                Originally developed for military use, they have found roles in law enforcement and even civilian shooting sports. 
                Their compact size and select-fire capability, which allows for both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire, make them 
                invaluable for tactical missions and personal defense in confined spaces. While advancements in firearm technology have led 
                to the development of more specialized weapons, the SMG continues to be a reliable choice for those seeking a balance between 
                firepower and portability in combat situations.</p>

            <h3> Assault Rifles </h3>
            <img src = "m4A1.png" width = "600px" height = "300px">
            <p> Assault rifles represent a pinnacle of modern military firearm design, combining the versatility of a rifle with selective 
                fire capabilities, typically offering semi-automatic and fully automatic or burst fire modes. These weapons are characterized 
                by their intermediate cartridge caliber, such as the widely used 5.56x45mm or 7.62x39mm, and a detachable magazine. 
                Assault rifles are designed for a wide range of combat scenarios, offering accuracy at longer ranges while still maintaining 
                rapid and sustained fire capabilities in close-quarter engagements. Their ergonomic features, adjustable stocks, and effective 
                recoil mitigation mechanisms contribute to their ease of use by soldiers and law enforcement personnel. Assault rifles have 
                become standard-issue weapons for many armed forces worldwide, owing to their adaptability and effectiveness in a variety of 
                combat situations. Despite controversy surrounding civilian ownership, they remain a symbol of modern military firepower and 
                technological innovation.
